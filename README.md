### My process
With clean organized code in mind, my process began with a plan, a written flowchart, and reading documentation to 
refresh my mind on Local Storage.


### Built with

- Custom CSS ( No frameworks )
- Custom HTML
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Local Storage


### What I learned

Fine tuning my DOM manipulation knowledge and researching different/more affective ways to place my code. 
Learned pseudo classes! Long over do but the next best time is now.
